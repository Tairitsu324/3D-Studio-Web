                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>The studio was originally established solely for modeling practice, with Kevin Wu as the only member. However, Jingqi Fan later began learning modeling, prompting the creation of the studio. Leonard Shang, having achieved some success in music, joined the studio as a full member in 2025.</p>

                    <p>This studio is a non-profit studio founded by high school students. Our goal is to express our inner world through the combination of 3D animation and music. We respect copyright information, and all content that needs to be marked with copyright will generally be placed in the description or at the end of the animation.</p>

                    <h2>In The Future</h2>
                    <p>Through the past two years of learning, we have gone from imitating other people's projects on Youtube and Bilibili to gradually creating our own style. In the future, we will learn more techniques and cultivate aesthetics to create more beautiful and profound works.</p>
